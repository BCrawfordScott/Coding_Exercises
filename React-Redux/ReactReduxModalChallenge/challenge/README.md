# Prompt

## React-Redux modals!

Build out the necessary React and Redux structure to make the given modals functional.

* All three modals should be opened from within the ModalMain Component.
* All three modals should be opened by invoking the same function but with different arguments.
* All modals should be closed by the same function.
* The state shape should stay the same as the example state.
* You must use redux state for the modals.
* Feel free to import/export whatever you like, but do not try to use third party libraries.
* It's recommended that you build actions, then reducer, then the components, but is not necessary.
