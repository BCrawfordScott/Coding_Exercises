# Technical Trivia

Technical trivia is a huge part of the interview process.  Both phone screens and on-sites can include a round or rounds of technical trivia. Making sure you are comfortable with the the trivia environment, the questions themselves, and how to answer them is invaluable in your job search.

### Strategy:

Whenever we are answering technical questions, we should always keep the following in mind:

* **Simple and concise answers:** There's no need to go in depth.  Try to keep your answers to one sentence.  If the interviewer wants you to go more into depth, they will ask you to.
* **Examples:** In some cases, a single sentence isn't enough, or perhaps your understanding of a concept isn't 100%.  In those cases use an example of whatever the answer is to the question, but try to keep the example in as few sentences as possible as well.
* **Be honest:** Do not try to answer if you know you do not have the answer. Dead air when you are grasping for an answer (especially over the phone) is never helpful. State confidently that you are not familiar with the answer and let the process continue.
* **KEEP STUDYING!** At the end of the day, the only sure fire way to get better is to keep studying.  We can never know all the answers, but we can always learn more.


***_NB_**: _This is just a sample of some common technical trivia questions. The reality is there's no knowing what trivia might be asked, so it's important to maintain your study habits on practical coding._
