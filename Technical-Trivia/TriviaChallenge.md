## Answers

##### Why do you need doctype?

* Doctype is an instruction to the browser to inform about the version of the html document and how browser should render it.
[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### What is the use of the data-* attribute?

* It allows you to store extra information/ data in the DOM. You can write valid html with embedded private data. You can easily access the data attribute by using javascript and hence a lot of libraries like knockout use it.
[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### How can you generate a public key in html?

*  Html has a keygen element that facilitates generation of a key and submission via a form.
```html
<keygen name="name" challenge="challenge string" keytype="type" keyparams="pqg-params">
```
[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### What does float do?

*  Float removes the element from the normal flow of the document and pushes the element to the sides of the page with text wrapping around it.

[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### Are CSS properties case sensitive?

* No

[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### What is position static?

```CSS
@media (max-width: 700px) and (orientation: landscape){}
```

* `0`, `""`, `NaN`, `-0`, `null`, `undefined`, `false`

[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### What is a primitive datatype in Javascript?

* A primitive datatype is not an object, is **immutable**, and has no attributes/methods defined directly on it

##### <a name='a-and-b'></a> If `const a = 2, b = 3`, what would be the value of `a && b`?
* 3

[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### Why does the following code work?
* Because named functions are hoisted and can be used before their declaration

[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### Is `null` an object?
* No. Even though `typeof null` returns `object`, this is a bug. You can not put any attributes on null, as it is a `primitive` datatype.

##### Are let and const hoisted?
* Yes

[Back to Round One qs](#round-one)

##### Briefly describe the concept of memoization
* Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. POJO's are often used to implement these caches.

##### Name all six primitive data-types in Javascript:

* boolean, string, number, null, undefined, and symbol (ES6 only)

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

* Undefined means the value of a variable is not defined. JS has a global variable called `undefined` whose value is `undefined`.
* `null` means empty or non-existent value which is used by programmers to indicate “no value”. Must be explicitly assigned.

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### What is the Temporal Dead Zone?

* This has to do with the topic of hoisting. The temporal deadzone is the time between entering a scope where a variable is declared (i.e. an `if` statement or `while` loop), and the actual declaration and initialization of that variable. During this period, `let` and `const` variables cannot be accessed (you will get a `Reference Error`), even though they have been hoisted. Example:

```js
console.log('out of scope');

if (true) {
  // Enter temporal deadzone. `x` is created and hoisted as soon as we enter scope.
  console.log('In the scope!');  // TEMPORAL DEADZONE
  // TEMPORAL DEADZONE
  let x = "Test Variable"; // No longer in the temporal deadzone
}
```

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### What is the Temporal Dead Zone?

* This has to do with the topic of hoisting. The temporal deadzone is the time between entering a scope where a variable is declared (i.e. an `if` statement or `while` loop), and the actual declaration and initialization of that variable. During this period, `let` and `const` variables cannot be accessed, even though they have been hoisted.

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### Can you directly compare two objects in Javascript

* No.

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### What does bind do?

* The bind method creates a _new_ function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first parameter passed into it. All subsequent parameters are arguments for that bound function.

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### What is the difference between window and document?

* JavaScript has a global object and everything runs under it. `window` is that global object that holds global variables, global functions, location, history everything is under it. `document` is also under window. document is a property of the window object. document represents the DOM and DOM is the object oriented representation of the html markup you have written

[Back to Round Two qs](#round-two)

##### <a name='data-binding'></a> What are two-way data binding and one-way data flow, and how are they different?

* This a tough-y 😎. Here's the deal: **Two-way data binding** means that UI fields are bound to model data dynamically. I.e., when a UI field changes, the model data changes with it and vice-versa. An example of this is Angular.js, which uses two-way binding. **One way data flow** means that the model is the **single source of truth**. A change in UI is not _directly_ bound to the model. An example of a one-way data flow framework is React. Only the model, or `store` in this case, has access to the application's state.

##### Does style1.css have to be downloaded before Paragraph 1 is rendered?

* Yes!

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### What is an optional closing tag?

* p, li, td, tr, th, html, body, etc. do not have to provide an end tag. However, you have to escape the tag.
```HTML
<p>Some text
<p>Some more text
<ul>
 <li>A list item
 <li>Another list item
</ul>
```
is read as:
```HTML
<p>Some text</p>
<p>Some more text</p>
<ul>
 <li>A list item</li>
 <li>Another list item</li>
</ul>
```

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### Does padding-top or padding-bottom effect inline elements?

* No

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### What is position absolute?

* The computed position of the element where it can be spaced after being removed to from the normal flow of the document.  It is spaced in relation to its' first non-static parent container with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### List css specificity rules from most specific to least specific:

* inline, ID, class, element, universal (4 out of 5 is acceptable)

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### Explain variable hoisting:

* At a broad level, hoisting is the concept of having access to named functions and variables (only `var`s) before they are declared in your code. This works because variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase.

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### Does javascript pass parameter by value or by reference?

* It depends on the datatype. Primitive types (string, number, etc.) are passed by value and objects are passed by reference. If you change a property of the passed object, the object will be affected.

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### <a name='event-loop'></a> In what order with the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?

* `1, 4, 3, 2`. 1 and 4 come first because they are logged without delay. 3 comes before 2 because it has a shorter asynchronous delay. Even though `3` has a delay of `0`, it is still placed on the event queue while the browser is busy. You can think of a `setTimeout` of `0` as meaning "as soon as possible".

[Back to Round Three qs](#round-three)

##### What are the three phases of event propagation?

* 1. Capturing phase: Events begin at the top level and move inwards towards the target (the node you clicked)
  2. Target node: If there are registered handlers at the target node, they are run.
  3. Bubbling phase: Event walks back outwards towards root; all encountered event handlers are run on the way.

##### What are the differences between div and span?

* Div is a block element and span is inline element. [Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### How would you differentiate div, section, and article?

* ```<section>``` , group of content inside is related to a single theme, and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page. It’s a chunk of related content, like a subsection of a long article, a major part of the page (eg the news section on the homepage), or a page in a webapp’s tabbed interface. A section normally has a heading (title) and maybe a footer too.

* ```<article>``` , represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

* ```<div>``` , on the other hand, does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.
[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### What is the difference between a canvas element and an SVG?
(Any of these points will suffice to illustrate the differences.)
* SVG: Object Model-based (SVG elements are similar to HTML elements).  Graphical elements become part of the DOM. Visual presentation created with markup and modified by CSS or script. API supports accessibility. API does not support accessibility; markup-based techniques must be used in addition to canvas.

* Canvas: Pixel-based (canvas is essentially an image element with a drawing API). Single HTML element similar to <img> in behavior. Visual presentation created and modified programmatically through script.
[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### Do padding-left, padding-right, margin-left, or margin-right effect inline elements?

* Yes!

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### Why can we call methods on certain primitive datatypes?

* Technically, you can't. **But**, certain primitive datatypes, like strings, numbers, and booleans, have _non_-primitive counterparts (String, Number, Boolean). So, if you call `"string".slice(5)`, that string will be implicitly cast to a `String` object, and the `slice` method will be called on that.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### What is position fixed?

* The computed position of an element where it's position is constant or 'fixed' in relation to the window.  Its' position and presence never change.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### What is position sticky?

* From MDN: It's treated as relatively positioned until its containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting top to value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" (it doesn't move) until meeting the opposite edge of its containing block.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)


##### <a name="equal"></a> What are the differences between `==` and `===` ?

* `==` will not check types and `===` will check whether both sides are of same type. `==` will convert to its convenient type to have both in same type and then do the comparison.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### How could you run event handler in the capturing phase not in bubble phase?

##### <a name='typeof'></a> What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?

* Although `typeof bar === "object"` is a reliable way of checking if bar is an object, the surprising gotcha in JavaScript is that null is also considered an object!

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### <a name='twofunctions'></a> Consider the following two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why not?

* The first function will return `Object { bar: "hello" }`. The second function will return `undefined`. This is because of semicolon insertion. The compiler will automatically put a semicolon after the return in the second function, therefor returning undefined.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### <a name='nan'></a> What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is equal to NaN?

* `NaN`s type is `Number`. `NaN` compared to _anything_, even itself, is false. One way to check if they are equal is using the built in `isNaN()` function.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### What is a closure in javascript?

* Specifically: A closure is an inner function that has access to the variables in the outer (enclosing) function’s scope chain. The closure has access to variables in three scopes; specifically: (1) variable in its own scope, (2) variables in the enclosing function’s scope, and (3) global variables.

##### What is asynchronous programming?

* Synchronous programming means code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O. Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop. When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and the code keeps running without blocking for the result.

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### <a name='scope-context'></a> What is the difference between scope and context?

* Scope is the lexical environment of the code/function("block scoped, function scoped, globally scoped") while context is to what the invoked function 'belongs' or what the function is being called upon, referred to as "this".

[Back to Round Four qs](#round-four)

##### <a name='css-positions'></a> What is the difference between position relative and position absolute?

*  Position relative places an element on the page in relation to its' normal position in the flow of the document, keeping the element within the flow of the document. The element can then be offset using 'top', 'bottom', 'left', or 'right' css properties.  Position absolute places the element in relation to it's closest non-static ancestor and removes the element from the normal flow of the document. The same css properties can move the element around the page.

Stacks are made up of stack frames that can be placed on the top of the stack, then popped off the top of the stack, like a pile of trays.  A stack overflow is when the number of stack frames on the stack reaches a predetermined limit and execution of stack frames is stopped to prevent infinitely processed operations.

##### What is a semantic tag?

* Semantic HTML, or "semantically-correct HTML", is HTML where the tags used to structure content are selected and applied appropriately to the meaning of the content.
For example, <b></b> (for bold), and <i></i> (for italic) should never be used, because they’re to do with formatting, not with the meaning or structure of the content. Instead, use the replacements <strong></strong> and <em></em> (meaning emphasis), which by default will turn text bold and italic (but don’t have to do so in all browsers), while adding meaning to the structure of the content.
